ABSA is a fine-grained sentiment analysis technique that aims to identify sentiments towards specific aspects in a given text. For instance, in the review \"The burger was great, but the fries were too salty\", the sentiment towards the \"burger\" aspect is positive, while it's negative for the \"fries\" aspect."

        "\n",
        "In this section, we utilize the `BertTokenizer` from the Hugging Face Transformers library. The tokenizer is designed for the BERT model and is pre-trained on the `'bert-base-uncased'` variant of BERT. This means it uses a vocabulary of words and subwords seen during the pre-training of BERT on a large corpus, and it does not consider letter casing (i.e., \"apple\" and \"Apple\" are treated the same).\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a breakdown of the steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Importing the Tokenizer**:\n",
        "    ```python\n",
        "    from transformers import BertTokenizer\n",
        "    tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "    We first import the `BertTokenizer` class and then instantiate a tokenizer object using the `'bert-base-uncased'` pre-trained version.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Tokenizing the Datasets**:\n",
        "    We tokenize three different sets of data: training, validation, and testing. Each dataset comprises original sentences and their corresponding auxiliary sentences.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - **Training Data**:\n",
        "        ```python\n",
        "        train_encodings = tokenizer(train_original_sentences, train_auxiliary_sentences, truncation=True, padding=True)\n",
        "        ```\n",
        "        Here, `train_original_sentences` and `train_auxiliary_sentences` are tokenized together. The `truncation=True` argument ensures that inputs longer than what the model can handle are truncated, and `padding=True` ensures that all outputs are padded to the same length.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - **Testing Data**:\n",
        "        ```python\n",
        "        test_encodings = tokenizer(test_original_sentences, test_auxiliary_sentences, truncation=True, padding=True)\n",
        "        ```\n",
        "        And finally, the testing sentences are tokenized.\n",
        "\n",
        "This process results in tokenized versions of our datasets, which are ready to be fed into the BERT model for training or evaluation.\n"
